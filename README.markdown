haskell-timecard
===========

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/wfleming/haskell-timecard/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/wfleming/haskell-timecard)

A simple timecard tool written in Haskell.
This is a port of [go-timecard][go-timecard]: I'm using this idea as a way of learning new languages & comparing different approaches.
For details about usage, etc. see the [go-timecard][go-timecard] README.
